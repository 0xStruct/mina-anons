# Mina-anons ðŸ¥·

Mina-anons is a zero-knowledge social layer which provides privacy and decentralizations for web3 and web2.

The project will explores the theme of bringing Mina ZK power to other blockchains and dApps

`Mina x Ethereum`, `Mina x Bitcoin` , `Mina x Snapshot.org` , etc

Demo sites: https://mina-anons.up.railway.app/ | https://mina-anons.vercel.app/

## Mina-anons: ðŸŽŠ CLUB

[ðŸŽŠ CLUB](ui) is the very first of Mina-anons dApp series

It enables an ethereum address to prove its ownership and membership of a specific club anonymously ...
then post an anonymous message.

Proof is stored on the decentralized IPFS and can be verified by anyone.

Sample proof: [IPFS pinned on Pinata](https://apricot-odd-wallaby-508.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreigpehz6ozqdgnhc74a32yhjzd73356zbcd6wefpzmcmd4sjm3nsim)

Pinata service is used for IPFS pinning.

## Mina-anons: ðŸ”¬ LAB

[ðŸ”¬ LAB](lab) is a playground to experiment with ECDSA support, tying in with Ethereum account address.

Work has been done to add BIP340 support to integrate with Bitcoin ecosystem.

Other account verification such as OAuth/JWT will be explored to add support for web2 platforms as well.

ownership or/and membership proofs can now be made by ethereum addresses and bitcoin/nostr addresses

## Mina-anons: ðŸ•¶âš¡ Anon Snapshot
[ðŸ•¶âš¡ Anon Snapshot](anon-snapshot) is to integrate privacy-preserving voting into `Snapshot.org`

A widely popular voting platform for DAOs used by millions of DAO members

It is used by Aave, ENS, ApeCoin, Starknet, Lido, Safe etc

With this project, the objective is to showcase that Mina could integrate into existing platforms seamlessly.
