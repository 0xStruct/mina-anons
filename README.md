# Mina-anons ðŸŽŠ CLUB

[ðŸŽŠ CLUB](club) is the very first of Mina-anons series

It enables an ethereum address to proof its ownership and membership of a specific club anonymously ...
then post a message.

_Please refer to the folder for detailed info in its README.md_

This is inspired by `AnonKlub.xyz` , `HeyAnon.xyz` and various other `confessions` accounts.

Proof is stored on the decentralized IPFS and can be verified by anyone.
